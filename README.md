Heart Disease Risk Analysis Project Report
1. Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data science and machine learning project focused on analyzing and predicting the risk of heart disease. It follows a standard machine learning workflow, including exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, model building, and performance evaluation. The final output is a classification model capable of predicting the presence or absence of heart disease in patients.

2. Project Goal
The primary objective of this project was to:

Perform a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset to uncover patterns and relationships between various health metrics and heart disease.

Build a machine learning model to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on their medical attributes.

3. Dataset
The project uses the UCI Heart Disease Dataset, a well-known dataset for classification tasks. The dataset contains a variety of medical attributes for patients, including age, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

4. Methodology
a. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase was crucial for understanding the data's characteristics. The following steps were performed:

Initial Data Inspection: Checked for missing values, data types, and descriptive statistics.

Target Variable Analysis: Visualized the distribution of the target variable to check for class imbalance.

Numerical Feature Analysis: Used histograms and box plots to analyze the distributions of key numerical features like age, chol (cholesterol), and thalach (maximum heart rate achieved).

Categorical Feature Analysis: Used count plots to examine the relationship between categorical features (e.g., sex, cp - chest pain type) and the target variable.

Correlation Analysis: Generated a heatmap of the correlation matrix to identify strong relationships between features and the target variable.

b. Data Preprocessing
To prepare the data for the machine learning model, the following preprocessing steps were implemented:

Feature and Target Separation: The dataset was split into a feature matrix (X) and a target vector (y).

Data Splitting: The data was divided into training and testing sets to ensure the model's performance could be evaluated on unseen data.

Feature Scaling: Numerical features were standardized using StandardScaler to give all features equal weight during model training.

One-Hot Encoding: Categorical features were converted into a numerical format using OneHotEncoder to make them understandable by the model.

c. Model Building & Evaluation
A Logistic Regression classifier was chosen for this binary classification problem.

Training: The model was trained on the preprocessed training data.

Prediction: The trained model was used to make predictions on the unseen test data.

Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using standard metrics, including:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (providing precision, recall, and F1-score)

5. Key Findings & Results
The EDA revealed that factors like chest pain type (cp), maximum heart rate achieved (thalach), and age were strongly correlated with the presence of heart disease.

The trained Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 0.82 on the test dataset, indicating that it correctly predicted the outcome for 82% of the cases.

The confusion matrix and classification report provided a detailed breakdown of the model's performance, showing its ability to predict both positive and negative cases.

6. Tools and Technologies
Python: The primary programming language.

Pandas & NumPy: Used for data manipulation and numerical operations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used for data visualization during the EDA phase.

Scikit-learn: The core library for all machine learning tasks, including preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

Jupyter Notebook: The interactive environment used for developing the project.

Git & GitHub: Used for version control and project hosting.
